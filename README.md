# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming variables/features for better representation and outcome of a predictive model using machine learning.

Some important steps in a feature engineering pipeline are - 

1. Missing data imputation. 
2. Categorical encoding.
3. Variable transformation.
4. Discretisation.
5. Outlier engineering.
6. Feature scaling

### Variable - Types and characteristics
Variables in a data set can be classified broadly into one of the types:

- **Numerical variables** 
- **Categorical variables**

The values of a numerical variable are numbers. They can be further classified into:

- **Discrete variables** - Number of children in a family.
- **Continuous variables** - Height of a person.

Additional data types such as **Date-time** and **mixed variables** are also common in a datset.
