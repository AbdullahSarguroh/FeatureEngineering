# FeatureEngineering

Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming variables/features for better representation and outcome of a predictive model using machine learning.

Some important steps in a feature engineering pipeline are - 

1. Missing data imputation. 
2. Categorical encoding.
3. Variable transformation.
4. Discretisation.
5. Outlier engineering.
6. Feature scaling
